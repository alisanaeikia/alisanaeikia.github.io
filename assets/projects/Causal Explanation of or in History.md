There are many works on the relation between causation and science; however, there are few in the field of social sciences, especially the study of history. In this paper, I investigate whether historical explanations should be like causal explanations, at least partially, or we cannot use causation in explaining history. I defend the view that David Lewisâ€™ counterfactual theory of causation would be a good thesis to be used in historical explanations. By this approach, I hope that to bring more justification for the counterfactual theory of causation as a unified theory, although I do not attempt to defend the unity of the concept of metaphysical causation in here.
