Hi Everyone!

I am a philosophy student at the University of Tehran.  I am thriving to get accepted to a PhD programme because I think it is the best job in the world. Trust me; I tried some other jobs.



I am primarily interested in practical philosophy, especially Ethics of AI. More specifically, I am interested in How humane concepts such as Love, friendship and... coud be reconsidered after introducing AI and its interaction with humans.  If you are interested in this subject, drop me an e-mail and let us discuss. You will probably help me to sleep at nights because this issue is keeping me awake nowadays.

Currently, I am writing my masters thesis on the deRosset's collapse problem and Meta-ground question. I am about to defend my thesis in few weeks! I needed to do a little Metaphysics to improve my  philosophical foundations. If you are interested, you can read my writing sample, which is on this website in projects.


I can go on and on about my other interests in philosophy, but I list some other areas which I am interested in: Ethics of technology, Ethics of objects, perception, causal powers, Avicennaâ€™s metaphysics and the intersection between metaphysics and philosophy of science.

My non- academic activities are visiting museums, watching cartoons, playing board games, walking around and visual coding. I hope someday the coding go somewhere and I could design some mesmerising animations.
