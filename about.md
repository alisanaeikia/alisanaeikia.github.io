Hi Everyone!

I am a philosophy student at the University of Tehran. I am thriving to get accepted to a PhD programme because I think it is the best job in the world. Trust me; I tried some other jobs.

I am primarily interested in metaphysics and philosophical logic and their relations to other topics. More specifically, I am interested in Metaphysical grounding.  Currently, I am writing my masters thesis on the collapse problem and Sider’s principle of purity. If you are interested in this subject, drop me an e-mail and let us discuss. You will probably help me to sleep at nights because this issue is keeping me awake nowadays.

Besides Grounding and its related topics like fundamentality, monism, the pure logic of it, etc., I am interested in Metaphysics of Time. I consider myself as a four dimensionalist, and I am trying to think about its relation to modality.

I can go on and on, but I list some other areas which I am interested in: essence, perception, causal powers, Avicenna’s metaphysics and the intersection between metaphysics and philosophy of science.

My non- academic activities are visiting museums, watching cartoons, playing board games, walking around and visual coding. I hope someday the coding go somewhere and I could design some mesmerising animations.
